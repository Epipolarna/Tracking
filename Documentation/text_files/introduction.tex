This document is the final documentation of mini-project performed as a part od the course Computer Vision (TSBB15) at Link√∂ping university. The purpose of the project is to implement a tracker capable of handling occlusion, shadows and changes in the background. The project goal was to create an application that can, in real-time, detect moving objects in an image sequence from e.g. a surveillance camera and track these. The application was implemented in C++ using the OpenCV API.

The purpose of this document is to provide a thorough description of how the application was created and the problems encountered during the implementation work.
