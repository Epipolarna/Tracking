This document is the final documentation of a mini-project performed as a part of the course Computer Vision (TSBB15) at Link√∂ping university. The purpose of the project is to implement a tracker capable of handling occlusion, shadows and changes in the background. Object tracking is, in computer vision, defined as the process where moving objects are located in a image sequence. The project goal was to create a real-time tracker to work on e.g. a surveillance camera and track the people and objects in its view. The application was implemented in C++ using the OpenCV API.

The purpose of this document is to provide a thorough description of how the application was created and the problems encountered during the implementation work.
