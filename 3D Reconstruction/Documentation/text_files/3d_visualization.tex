This module visualizes the calculated points and the camera positions relative to the position of the first camera. This part of the program is written on top of the OpenGL graphics API.

It can be run as a stand alone program, or as a last step in the 3D-reconstruction pipline. In the standalone case it will read the output files generated by the reconstruction pipeline. Using the keyboard a user can then step between the added cameras, with or without the bundle adjustment step done.

It is also possible to alter the scale of the points and cameras, as there is no automatic scaling in place and the points are drawn as colored spheres.
