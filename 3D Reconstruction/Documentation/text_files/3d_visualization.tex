A 3D visualisation program is implemented using SFML and OpenGL, it can place cameras and points at arbitrary positions in space.

The visualizer reads the files generated by the 3D-reconstruction pipeline and displays the data. It allows for stepping between the different
added cameras and their respective bundle adjustment steps.
