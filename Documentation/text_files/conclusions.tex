\subsubsection{Noise removal}
There are several algorithms implemented for the foreground segmentation, however the one described above is the one which delivers the best performance in terms of noise removal and reliability. However, it can be rather slow if there are a lot of objects to track, and to enable the segmentation to run in real-time, one might want to choose one of the faster implementations, where noise removal is handled by some erode/dilate sequences.
