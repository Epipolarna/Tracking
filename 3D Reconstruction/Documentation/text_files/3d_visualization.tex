A 3D visualisation program is implemented using SFML and OpenGL, it can place cameras and points at arbitrary positions in space.

The visualizer reads the files generated by the 3D-reconstruction pipeline and displays the data. It allows for stepping between the different
added cameras and their respective bundle adjustment steps.

%Texturing of the calculated points is also implemented using a texture derived from the region around the original 2D-point.
