The main program is composed of two parts. The first one is initiation part, where the modules are declared, parameters specified, and movie clip loaded. The second one is the main loop, where the actual program is executed.


\subsubsection{Main loop}
The separate modules are called in the order described above.
Once all the processing in the module is finished the objects in the current frame are drawn in the current frame as bounding boxes with velocity vectors, position in pixel coordinates and ID numbers.
