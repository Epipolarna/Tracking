This document is the final documentation of mini-project performed as a part od the course Computer Vision (TSBB15) at Link√∂ping university. The project goal was to create an application that can, in real-time, detect motion in an image sequence from e.g. a surveillance camera. The application was implemented in C++ using the OpenCV API.

The purpose of this document is to provide a thorough description of how the application was created and the problems encountered during the implementation work.
